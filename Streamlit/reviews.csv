"I cannot say enough good things about this car service! We arrived to the airport in style!! It was a very smooth and comfortable ride for 7 people with luggage. <br /><br />The driver was prompt and very communicative! He was dressed in a suit, very professional. <br /><br />We took two taxi’s from the airport and the price of that was comparable to the price of this service and it was 150% safer and comfortable!! <br /><br />I am definitely going to use them in the future!!","I cannot say enough good things about this car service!

"Great service and easy to organize.  Received a response to my email quickly and had my ride scheduled and payment set within a few hours.  Leaving for a flight at 3:30am, I was very anxious about using a car service (and having them show up on time) but the excellent reviews for Precision were all accurate, our driver arrived at 3:15, let us know he was here, and was very professional.  We got to the airport smoothly and without worry.  Will definitely use the service again!","Great service and easy to organize.

"We have used them 6 times this past year for my daughter and now us.  They are stellar at communication.  They are there when they say they will be.  We landed at JFK and when I turned my phone on the driver had just texted me.  Even with flight delays and changes they can pivot very easily.  Their fleet is pristine, and their drivers are amazing.  I will ALWAYS use them.  So worth it to have them drive you through the city/pick up/ etc.  ","We have used them 6 times this past year for my daughter and now us.  They are stellar at communication.

"Great, Professional Drivers.  They were early and helpful.  Offered us water and the cars were extremely nice and clean.  We were made to feel very comfortable after a long flight with such great service.  We were picked up at JFK and taken to our hotel in Times Square.  They picked us up at our hotel and took us back to JFK for our early flight home.<br /><br />I highly recommend this company and will use them again.  I have referred people to use their service.","Great, Professional Drivers.  They were early and helpful.  Offered us water and the cars were extremely nice and clean.

"Great communication and service. Someone answers phone, easy to book, they worked with me on having to bump a scheduled ride to a bit later in day. <br />Booked airport transfers from Newark to hotel in Manhattan and back as well as a point to point for an evening event. <br />Drivers arrived early, were very polite and cars very clean as well as upscale (Cadillac, suburban, etc. ) <br />Would definitely use them again and recommend to others.

"We flew to NYC September 26 returning September 28, 2023. We were just there for a doctor’s appointment. We used their limo service to travel to and from our hotel on 92nd street from/to LGA.  They were excellent. They were at the airport when we landed and picked us up early from our hotel.<br />It was so much easier than trying to get a cab and the expense was worth it.

"Cheema was our driver, on June 17, 2023. He arrived at Newark airport, on time, in a beautiful black Yukon GMC. The car was immaculate inside and very comfortable. Cheema was so courteous and loaded all our luggage into the vehicle. He is an excellent driver and very pleasant! He drove us to a hotel in Staten Island and it was the best experience driving in congested traffic. He is an expert and an asset to Precsion NY chauffeur service!

I just wanted to make sure to let everyone know this car service was excellent. I would recommend and have recommended to many people using this service for travel to and from LaGuardia airport into Manhattan. This was my first time traveling from the airport to the city and they were very helpful. They answered all of my questions and gave me great advice. The drivers were very professional and made the drive very pleasant and enjoyable. I was really nervous picking out a car service and read many reviews. Needless to say it seemed there were many car services to choose from and there was always something negative to be said. Precision NY was the best choice I could have ever made and if I ever get the chance to travel to NYC again I will definitely use them.

"I was on a holiday to celebrate our 25th Wedding anniversary and needed transportation from Midtown to the Liberty cruise terminal.  After checking reviews on a number of Limo companies I decided on Precision NYC and they delivered.   I called and booked over the phone from UK as I prefer to talk to a real person and the process was simple and straightforward.  On the day of pickup the driver called me 45 mins ahead of schedule and waited around the corner until we were ready.   We made our way outside and was greeted by a gleaming spotless limo with an equally sharply dressed driver in Malik.   He was a great guy and initially courteous but not chatty (not everyone wants to talk at the best of times), but when engaged was a really great guy and a pleasure to talk to.  The journey was super comfortable and a real great experience which was the perfect way to end our NY trip and start our cruise.  I cannot recommend highly enough","I was on a holiday to celebrate our 25th Wedding anniversary and needed transportation from Midtown to the Liberty cruise terminal.

"Made our second trip to NYC this last weekend and used Precision for our airport transfer to and from our hotel in Manhattan. We also used them on our first visit. They were great. Would highly recommend using their services. Each time the vehicles are very clean and the drivers are timely and attentive. I received a text message as soon as our plane touched down at JFK. Upon collecting our luggage, Vik met us at the curb to pick us up. He was on time and courteous. On our way from the hotel to the airport Khuram picked us up. He was great as well. He was on time (early) and got us to JFK timely.

"Totally reliable and I would highly recommend.<br />I booked an Airport collection , delays at JFK through Passport Control were ridiculous.<br />I communicated with the driver who was patient and understanding despite having another booking to get to.<br />The SUV was fabulous, spotless , comfortable , our driver Vick friendly and professional in all aspects.<br />I also booked a return journey and again the SUV for a family of 5 was spacious, the driver prompt , the vehicle spotless , comfortable and despite even worse traffic than expected we arrived at the Airport in plenty of time and dropped right outside.<br />I really do recommend this company. New York Traffic is hard going, lots of horns blaring and lane swapping.<br />Give yourself plenty of time, sit back and relax in comfort, it’s is more than 45 mins from JFK to Times Square, which is what the books say.<br />Our inbound journey was just over an hour our return one and a half. This is due to on going road works and infrastructure change.","Totally reliable and I would highly recommend.<br />I booked an Airport collection , delays at JFK through Passport Control were ridiculous.<br />I communicated with the driver who was patient and understanding despite having another booking to get to.<br />The SUV was fabulous, spotless , comfortable , our driver Vick friendly and professional in all aspects.<br />I also booked a return journey and again the SUV for a family of 5 was spacious, the driver prompt , the vehicle spotless , comfortable and despite even worse traffic than expected we arrived at the Airport in plenty of time and dropped right outside.<br />I really do recommend this company.

"I did extensive research for private transportation between JFK airport to Midtown Manhattan before committing to Precision and I'm glad I did.  All positive reviews for Precision are spot-on.  The communication, service and attention to detail were all EXCEPTIONAL. Immediately at landing, I received a text from our chauffeur Abdul.  He advised that he was already at the airport, make/model of vehicle and license plate number.  He was easy to locate and he made our travel into Manhattan exceptionally smooth and friendly.  On our departure date, Ismael text me that he was on-site.  He was at the hotel early (no complaints there) and he made our travel back to JFK airport efficient with plenty of time to spare.

I was so impressed with this service - from the representatives I worked with to book rides to the drivers themselves.

"Este fue mi cuarto viaje con Rich Limo y será el último. Los conductores son generalmente increíbles, pero en este caso, nuestro conductor llegó tarde a recogernos para el viaje al aeropuerto, pero envió un mensaje de texto falso a la hora de recogida para decirnos que nos estaba esperando en el lobby de nuestro hotel. Él no estaba. Fue para cubrir sus huellas con la empresa. Lo estaba esperando afuera del hotel, pero volví adentro (dejando mis maletas desatendidas) para asegurarme de que no pudiera pasarme al vestíbulo y, por supuesto, no estaba allí como dijo. Llamé al número que figuraba en su mensaje de texto y me dijo que estaba en camino. Después de llegar unos 5 minutos tarde, nos sacó de la ruta, se detuvo en una calle lateral y dejó una bolsa de papel marrón y una botella de licor con un extraño en la calle, entablando una conversación (en otro idioma, así que teníamos no hay forma de seguirlo) durante aproximadamente un minuto, sin darnos explicaciones a nosotros, sus pasajeros que pagaban. Luego nos dirigimos al aeropuerto, 15 minutos después de la hora de recogida programada. Era fin de semana de Acción de Gracias, así que no queríamos retrasos, pero llegamos a tiempo para tomar nuestro vuelo, aunque sin tiempo para comer antes del largo vuelo. Después me quejé con la gerencia porque automáticamente cobran un 20% de propina, y no pensé que el conductor se lo merecía después de llegar tarde y luego hacer una parada adicional antes de partir hacia el aeropuerto. El gerente, Richard, discutió conmigo después de consultar con el conductor e insistió en que el conductor dijo que estaba en el hotel 3 minutos antes y citó su texto falso como prueba, por lo que básicamente me llamó mentiroso. Dijo que el inglés del conductor era simplemente malo y en lugar de decir que estaba en el vestíbulo, quiso decir que en realidad estaba enfrente. Nada de eso es cierto porque lo estaba esperando en el frío afuera (y él, por supuesto, me dijo que aún no había llegado por teléfono). También dijo que tenía que dejar un artículo que un pasajero anterior se habían ido, por lo que admitió que tomaron un desvío pero dijo que era una cortesía que extienden a todos los pasajeros, evidentemente en el horario del cliente y no en el suyo propio. El gerente incluso dijo que el conductor nos ayudó a sacar nuestras maletas del automóvil en el aeropuerto, lo que habría pensado que estaba incluido en la tarifa de $ 185, pero ahora me pregunto si eso se considera adicional. En general, fue una mala experiencia con un conductor que llegó tarde, intentó cubrir sus huellas, tomó desvíos adicionales y una empresa que no valoraba nuestro tiempo ni nuestras preocupaciones. Un Uber habría sido igual de bueno, y costaría la mitad, y al menos no me habría sorprendido si hubieran hecho una parada de entrega de comida en nuestro viaje.","This was my fourth trip with Rich Limo and it will be the last.The drivers are generally incredible, but in this case, our driver came late to pick us up for the trip to the airport, but sent a false text message at the time of collection to tell us that he was waiting for us in the lobby of our hotel.He was not there.It was to cover their footprints with the company.I was waiting outside the hotel, but I returned inside (leaving my unattended suitcases) to make sure I couldn't go to the lobby and, of course, I wasn't there as he said.I called the number that appeared in his text message and told me he was on his way.After arriving about 5 minutes late, he took us out of the route, stopped on a side street and left a brown paper bag and a bottle of liquor with a stranger on the street, starting a conversation (in another language, so we hadThere is no way to follow it) for about a minute, without giving us explanations to us, their passengers they paid.Then we go to the airport, 15 minutes after the scheduled collection time.It was thanksgiving weekend, so we didn't want delays, but we arrived in time to take our flight, although without time to eat before the long flight.Then I complained with management because they automatically charge 20% tip, and I did not think that the driver deserved it after arriving late and then making an additional stop before leaving for the airport.The manager, Richard, argued with me after consulting the driver and insisted that the driver said he was at the hotel 3 minutes before and cited his false text as proof, so he basically called me a liar.He said that the driver's English was simply bad and instead of saying that he was in the lobby, he meant that he was actually in front.None of that is true because I was waiting for him in the cold outside (and he, of course, told me that he had not yet arrived on the phone).He also said that he had to leave an article that a previous passenger had left, so he admitted that they took a detour but said it was a courtesy that extend all passengers, evidently at the time of the client and not on their own.The manager even said that the driver helped us take out our automobile suitcases at the airport, which would have thought it was included in the $ 185 rate, but now I wonder if that is considered additional.In general, it was a bad experience with a driver who was late, tried to cover his footprints, took additional deviations and a company that did not value our time or our concerns.An Uber would have been just as good, and cost half, and at least I would not have surprised me if they had made a food delivery stop on our trip.",Paradise22017912160,Queja por conductor,0

"No es lo mejor. El tiempo de espera asignado es de 60 minutos después de la llegada del avión. Mirando los tiempos de espera del aeropuerto/sitio web de aduanas y patrulla fronteriza: nuestro tiempo de espera solo para la aduana sería un promedio de 44 minutos, lo que significa que el tiempo de recogida de 60 minutos no es realista y, por lo tanto, generaría automáticamente un cargo. Sugerimos de manera muy razonable (y cortés) que modifiquemos nuestra hora de llegada, compartiendo que estaríamos encantados de esperar en la llegada en lugar de pagar un cargo. Solo me dijeron que no era razonable sugerir esto y nuestra reserva fue cancelada; no hubo comunicación sobre el asunto ni solicitud de aclaración, simplemente cancelada. Me incomoda un poco que tengas que proporcionar tus datos bancarios para hacer la reserva y luego la cancelen de manera bastante frívola, pero ese no es el motivo principal de mi queja.<br />No es el mejor servicio al cliente: no comprende, no razona y es bastante brusco. Creo que, a menos que puedas garantizar que saldrás en 60 minutos (lo cual no estoy seguro de cómo puedes hacerlo), elegiría un servicio que esté más centrado en la satisfacción del cliente.","It is not the best.The assigned waiting time is 60 minutes after the arrival of the plane.Looking at the waiting times of the Customs and Border Patrol website: our waiting time only for customs would be an average of 44 minutes, which means that the 60 -minute collection time is not realistic and, therefore,, would automatically generate a position.We suggest very reasonably (and polite) that we modify our arrival time, sharing that we would be happy to wait for arrival instead of paying a position.They only told me that it was not reasonable to suggest this and our reservation was canceled;There was no communication on the matter or request for clarification, simply canceled.It bothers me a little that you have to provide your bank data to make the reservation and then cancel it quite frivolous, but that is not the main reason for my complaint. <br /> It is not the best customer service: it does not understand,It does not reason and is quite abrupt.I think that, unless you can guarantee that you will be in 60 minutes (which I am not sure of how you can do it), I would choose a service that is more focused on customer satisfaction.",emmalyons88,Otro,2

"Sadly,we were badly let down by Luxor. We landed delayed from London but we had been told before that the company monitors the flights.

On our return trip we were unfortunately delayed through US Immigration/Customs by over an hour.  No worries, Freddy was patiently waiting for us!

"¡TENER CUIDADO! Operador de estafa<br /><br />TLDR: no reserve su servicio si desea un servicio de transporte confiable y puntual. Los Uber son los mejores.<br /><br />Pagué más de 550 dólares por una furgoneta de lujo que me llevaría desde Manhattan al aeropuerto JFK, previsto para las 4 de la tarde del 26 de diciembre de 2023.<br /><br />La “furgoneta de lujo” no apareció. A pesar de que llamé a la oficina de Jet Black varias veces, aparentemente no pude contactar con el conductor. La oficina tampoco envió ningún conductor de reemplazo. Después de esperar cerca de media hora, mi familia y yo nos subimos a un par de Uber XL (que tardaron 2 minutos en llegar) para llegar al aeropuerto. Si hubiera esperado más por Jet Black, definitivamente habría perdido mi vuelo internacional.<br /><br />Terriblemente decepcionado con el servicio (o la falta del mismo) que brindó Jeblack.

"Evitar como la peste. Solicité un traslado a las 7:00 am desde el centro de la ciudad hasta JFK en una camioneta. Mi esposa y yo llegamos al frente a las 6:55 am. Sin conductor. 7:00 am. Sin conductor. 7:05 am. Sin conductor. Llamo y me dice que está cerca. A las 7:08 de la mañana llega una minivan Toyota destartalada y el conductor vestía vaqueros y un Polo desgastado. No es una gran impresión.<br /><br />El interior estaba semilimpio, pero parecía que su familia estaba allí. Empecé a conducir y no iba bien; la suspensión de la furgoneta necesita ser reemplazada desesperadamente; todavía me duele la espalda. Luego, el conductor condujo como un loco, entrando y saliendo (había algunos ""queridos dioses"" de mi esposa y muchos ojos cerrados). Entiendo que esto es Nueva York, pero fue terrible.<br /><br />Llego al aeropuerto (afortunadamente, ileso) e intento llamar a Jet Black. 5 tiempos separados. Nadie contestó. Entonces, le envié un mensaje de texto, informándole que el conductor llegaba tarde y que no era el auto que solicité y que conducía de manera muy insegura. La respuesta que recibí fue que el conductor llegó ""sólo 7 minutos tarde"" (no es cierto, llegó 9 minutos tarde) y una minivan ES una SUV (creo que mucha gente discutiría eso; además, eso no se reveló en el sitio web). ). Entonces, si llegaba tarde, me cobrarían, pero cuando su chico llega tarde, eso depende de mí de alguna manera. Entiendo.<br /><br /> 30 minutos después recibí un mensaje de texto confirmando el auto que me recogió y dije que sí, que era. 40 minutos después recibo otro mensaje de texto que dice ""hay mucho tráfico en Nueva York y túneles con la ciudad"". Y me ofrecieron un descuento del 5 %. ¡Guau, 5 %! ! Eso sí, esto es después de que te hagan pagar por adelantado una propina del 20 %.<br /><br />Respondo diciendo que eso no es lo suficientemente bueno. Y Jet Black responde con, oh, absolutamente nada. 13 horas después, vuelvo a enviar un mensaje de texto pidiendo una respuesta cuando me ofrecen un entusiasta reembolso del 10 % de la propina.<br /><br />La razón por la que alguien elige un servicio de automóvil es para obtener un viaje confirmado a una hora confirmada; con Uber o Lyft, los viajes se programan y cancelan todo el tiempo. Una persona también elige un servicio de coche porque el coche suele ser de mayor calidad y el conductor es seguro y responsable. Ninguna de esas cosas sucedió aquí y Jet Black solo trató de poner excusas y racionalizaciones y nunca se disculparon por mentir en su sitio web sobre el vehículo, el hecho de que su conductor llegó tarde y que condujo de manera muy insegura.<br /><br />Preferiría caminar hasta JFK en la nieve y luego usar Jet Black nuevamente.","Avoid how the plague.I requested a transfer at 7:00 am from the city center to JFK in a truck.My wife and I arrived at the front at 6:55 am.Without driver.7:00 am.Without driver.7:05 am.Without driver.I call and tell me it's close.At 7:08 in the morning a drearted Toyota Minivan arrives and the driver wore jeans and a worn pole.It is not a great impression. <br /> <br /> The interior was semilimpio, but it seemed that his family was there.I started driving and it didn't go well;The suspension of the van needs to be desperately replaced;My back still hurts.Then, the driver led like a madman, entering and dating (there were some ""dear gods"" of my wife and many closed eyes).I understand that this is New York, but it was terrible. <br /> <br /> I arrived at the airport (fortunately, unharmed) and try to call Jet Black.5 separate times.No one answered.Then, I sent him a text message, informing him that the driver was late and that it was not the order I requested and that he drove very insecurely.The answer I received was that the driver arrived ""only 7 minutes late"" (it is not true, he arrived 9 minutes late) and a minivan is a SUV (I think many people would discuss that; in addition, that was not revealed on the website).).Then, if I was late, they would charge me, but when his boy is late, that depends on me in some way.I understand. <br /> <br /> 30 minutes later I received a text message confirming the car that picked me up and said yes, it was.40 minutes later I receive another text message that says ""there is a lot of traffic in New York and tunnels with the city.""And they offered me a 5 %discount.Wow, 5 %!!Of course, this is after they make you pay in advance a tip of 20 %. <br /> <br /> I answer saying that is not good enough.And Jet Black responds with, oh, absolutely nothing.13 hours later, I send a text message again asking for an answer when they offer me an enthusiastic refund of 10 % of the tip. <br /> <br /> The reason why someone chooses a car service is to obtain aTrip confirmed at a confirmed hour;With Uber or Lyft, trips are scheduled and canceled all the time.A person also chooses a car service because the car is usually higher and the driver is safe and responsible.None of those things happened here and Jet Black only tried to put excuses and rationalizations and never apologized for lying on their website on the vehicle, the fact that its driver was late and that he drove very insecurely. <br /><br /> I would prefer to walk to JFK in the snow and then use Jet Black again.",derrek m,Queja por conductor,0

"Estive em NYC por 04 dias no início de fevereiro de 2024 com a minha família e a experiência foi incrivelmente  espetacular graças ao excelente trabalho e profissionalismo da agência Vou Para New York (VPNY). Tudo começou  na programação em maio/23, quando fechei os transfers e o passeio Dreamy com a July e Melissa. Mais para o final do ano , tive dificuldade em comprar os ingressos da Broadway pelo site e fui gentilmente atendido pelo Bruno, idealizador e proprietário da VPNY, que prontamente solucionou o problema. Aliás, sigo o Bruno nas redes sociais e as suas dicas de viagem foram muito importantes para nós! Chegando em NYC, o Flavio já estava nos esperando e nos levou de forma leve e agradável até o nosso hotel. No dia seguinte, fizemos o Dreamy com o Guilherme, guia fantástico que nos proporcionou o melhor passeio de nossas vidas, com muitas histórias de NYC, músicas, gordices e principalmente muita emoção! No terceiro dia, tive dificuldades com a impressão dos ingressos da Broadway e a Gaby foi um anjo, resolvendo de forma ágil e carinhosa nossos problemas. Por fim, o transfer da volta foi realizado pela Greicy, guria super alto astral, pontual e muito atenciosa comigo e com a minha família. <br />Desculpem-me pelo textão, mas era a única forma de agradecer de coração à toda família VPNY que deram um show de competência e talento. Se já era fã antes da viagem, agora sou muito mais. <br />Espero revê-los em breve!!!","I was in NYC for 04 days in early February 2024 with my family and the experience was incredibly spectacular thanks to the excellent work and professionalism of the Agency Vou for New York (VPNY).It all started on the schedule in May/23, when I closed the transfers and the Dreamy tour with July and Melissa.More at the end of the year, I had difficulty buying Broadway tickets through the site and was kindly attended by Bruno, VPNY's creator and owner, who promptly solved the problem.By the way, I follow Bruno on social networks and his travel tips were very important to us!Arriving in NYC, Flavio was already waiting for us and took us lightly and pleasantly to our hotel.The next day, we did Dreamy with Guilherme, a fantastic guide that provided us with the best ride of our lives, with many stories of NYC, music, fat and especially a lot of emotion!On the third day, I had difficulties with the impression of Broadway tickets and Gaby was an angel, solving our problems agile and lovingly.Finally, the transfer of the return was made by Greicy, Guria Super High Astral, punctual and very attentive to me and my family.<br /> Sorry for the text, but it was the only way to thank the whole VPNY family who gave a concert of competence and talent.If I was a fan before the trip, now I'm much more.<br /> I hope to review them soon !!!",Paulo Silveira,Recomendación por buen servicio del conductor,2

We called after midnight, left a message and got a call back that morning.  We had called again that morning in the event that we would have to look elsewhere but lucky for us they had availability.  We booked two cars and they sent us SUVs that were in great condition and the professionalism of Dharmendra and Ahmad were awesome.  I received a text confirming the pickup right after booking and a text once the cars arrived at the venue.  Since they arrived  about 30 minutes early I met them outside and told them it would take me a few minutes to round up the group.  They patiently waited and assisted in placing the items we had into the car.   I have to tell you it was one of the smoothest rides I've taken.  Even my son called me the next morning to tell me about his drive home how smooth it was.  We were very impressed about the service.  They got my precious cargo (my adult children) home safe and sound and bride and groom driven home in style.

Excellent from start to finish. Just arrived back from New York and cannot fault the transfers.  Donny even helped and advised as we didn’t know New York roads shut down early on New Year’s Eve and we would have been stuck getting to the airport for our evening flight.  The cars were spotless and the drivers communicated via what’s app as soon as we landed and gave us lots of notice when we were being collected from the hotel.  A shout out to Mark who gave me lots of tips and information on the way to our hotel and made the journey go really quick even though we were stuck in traffic.  I would definitely use this company again and getting the meet and greet on our arrival just took the pressure off as it was the first time I had travelled on my own with my son.  The one thing I would suggest is to add at least an hour to hour and a half onto your landing time for pick up collection time as passport control was so busy so you may miss your transfer.,Excellent from start to finish.

"Warning this company is no longer reliable. They DOUBLED the price of my ride the day of the event and CHARGED MY CARD OVER $1000 without my permission. I am currently working to get $390 back still.<br />I do not know if they changed management, but I experienced the most unprofessional car service booking of my life. I booked a sprinter van for 14 ppl for the night of NYE. After booking online I called to ensure the booking was accurate and received by all parties. The day of my booking, I received a notification that the price for my trip leaving had doubled!! Their reasoning was because the driver I had decided to raise his price due the holiday. I’m not sure what that has to do with me as a customer?? Dial 7 should have dealt with the driver internally rather than punishing a customer the day of their event! I actually ended up having to negotiate the driver down through the phone operator (yes this is crazy but I had no other choice at the time). <br /><br />After agreeing to pay the driver a higher rate, a few hours later, I see a charge on my card for $648!!! Like what! Keep in mind the total cost of my trip was about $880 so where does that number even come from?<br /><br />I called to complain 3 times. The first time, the operate said it was to check my funds and would be refunded within the hour. When it was not refunded, I called again and an extremely rude and uninformed man told me that the previous operator gave me the wrong information (???) and I would not receive my money back until after I paid for the first trip. I hung up out of frustration and called back later for more clarity. Upon calling a 3rd time, I notice that my account was charged again for $390. I nearly had a heart attack. I haven’t been that mad in a LONG time. <br /><br />I called again and threatened to call my bank and report fraud and I accused them of being scammers. The operate let me know the only way to refund me would be to cancel my trip. When I asked if she could rebook I heard the same rude male operators voice in the background demanding the woman on the phone to hang up on me and cancel my trip entirely without rebooking. <br /><br />Long story short, my trip was canceled. I received a refund a few hours later for the $648 and I’m still waiting on the $390. I called them today and will report fraud if it is not deposited within the next couple hours. <br /><br />Ultimately, it was a blessing they canceled because I definitely did not want to support them after all they went through. We were actually able to fit our group of 14 into two large Ubers which we scheduled a few hours earlier. The price stays the same if you schedule in advance. <br /><br />Do not ruin your plans trying to book with this company they are extremely rude and unprofessional and irresponsible with credit cards. I still can’t believe they charged my card like that. Feeling financially violated. I never leave reviews, but refuse to accept that.

I called and spoke to a dispatcher who said the driver is 5 minutes away and it’s not that big of a deal. I reiterated that I had a flight to catch and if it was going to be longer to let me know and I’ll have to find another way to the airport. 15 minutes later still no driver or communication. I called back and was told they are now 13 minutes away due to traffic.

By 5am, I cancelled the car service so who knows when they would have shown up. Incredibly unprofessional, do not use dial 7 if you actually need to get somewhere.
